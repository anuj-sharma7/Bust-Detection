"""Build the bundled India basemap from DataMeet's boundary shapefile.

    python -m scripts.build_basemap

Why a bundled basemap at all: the map's tile layer needs an external CDN, and an
operations room may not have one - or may be behind a policy that blocks it. A
map that degrades to markers floating on an empty background is useless exactly
when it matters, so the country is drawn from geometry shipped with the app.

Source
------
DataMeet's ``States/Admin2`` shapefile - 36 states and union territories in
WGS84, about 1.07 million vertices. Licensed CC BY 4.0, which is why it is used
here in preference to the several unlicensed India GeoJSON repositories doing
the rounds: those carry no rights grant at all, and a couple explicitly disclaim
accuracy.

Simplification
--------------
A million vertices is three orders of magnitude more than a national-scale
dashboard can show. Ramer-Douglas-Peucker reduces each ring to the points that
carry its shape, then coordinates are rounded to three decimals - about 110 m,
which is far finer than a 0.25 degree forecast grid and invisible at any zoom
this map opens at.

Small rings are dropped, with one exception that matters: the largest ring of
every state is always kept. Without that, island territories - Lakshadweep,
parts of Andaman and Nicobar - vanish from the map entirely, which would be both
wrong and, for a map of India, unacceptable.

A boundary note
---------------
This is a cartographic aid for locating forecast points, not an authoritative
boundary. Official boundaries of India are published by the Survey of India, and
anything with legal or official standing must come from there.
