"""Early-warning alert engine.

An alert is raised when the assessed bust risk for a monitored site crosses the
HIGH band (61%). Alerts are *decision support*: they say "this forecast may be
unreliable", never "this weather will happen". That distinction is enforced in
the wording here and repeated throughout the UI.
