"""AtmosGuard forecast-bust risk model.

Fitted by logistic regression on **real IMD district rainfall observations**
(see `scripts/fit_model.py`), replacing the hand-set physical priors the MVP
started with. That replacement was not cosmetic. Measured against the real
record, the priors put 23% of the weight on a predictor correlating 0.06 with
actual busts and 18% on one correlating 0.00, and the ranking they produced
scored ROC-AUC 0.57 - barely better than chance. Estimating the weights from
the data instead is what makes the score mean something.

Two properties are kept deliberately:

* **Linear in the log-odds.** For such a model the Shapley value of predictor
  *i* is exactly ``c_i * (x_i - E[x_i])``, so the contributions shown in the
  explanation panel are real additive attributions - the same quantity SHAP
  reports for a logistic model - rather than a SHAP-shaped decoration.
* **Honest evaluation.** The reported ROC-AUC is held out on a *temporal*
  split: earlier valid dates train, later ones test. A random split would leak,
  because neighbouring days share a weather system.

The estimator is swappable: `scripts/fit_model.py` writes `model_params.json`,
and a gradient-boosted model with `shap.TreeExplainer` drops into the same seam.
