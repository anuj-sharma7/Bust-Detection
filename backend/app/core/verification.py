"""Forecast verification and risk-model performance metrics.

Two distinct kinds of verification live here, and the UI keeps them apart:

1. **Forecast verification** - how well the *weather forecast* did against the
   observed / reanalysis value (RMSE, MAE, bias, anomaly correlation).
2. **Risk-model verification** - how well the *bust-risk classifier* did at
   flagging the forecasts that went on to bust (ROC-AUC, precision, recall,
   F1, Brier score, reliability).

Both are computed from the demonstration dataset at request time; none of the
numbers are hard-coded, so retuning the generator moves them honestly. The
metric implementations are plain numpy so the MVP has no scikit-learn
dependency, and they are unit-tested against known cases.
