"""Catalogue of official data sources for AtmosGuard.

Every entry is a real, publicly documented portal. The catalogue is data rather
than prose so it can drive three things at once: the download CLI, the System
page in the UI, and `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.

**Read this before trusting a URL.** Portal-level addresses are stable and are
given here verbatim. Deep links to individual files are *not* stable - agencies
reorganise them, and several of these portals require you to accept terms or
log in before a download link is issued. So each entry gives the portal, the
dataset name as the agency publishes it, and what to look for once you are
there. Confirm the exact path at the source rather than assuming a link in this
file still resolves.

Access levels:
  open        - direct download, no account
  key         - free API key from a self-service registration
  account     - free account plus, usually, accepting a data-use agreement
  restricted  - request form, institutional affiliation, or paid licence
