# AtmosGuard

**Reads the forecast before it fails.**

AtmosGuard is an AI-based **forecast bust risk and early-warning system** for
medium-range (Day 3–7) weather forecasts. It does not forecast the weather. It
assesses how likely an existing forecast is to be *wrong*, explains why, and
raises the flag before the event — so a forecaster can shift weight onto
ensemble and short-range guidance while there is still time to act.

> AtmosGuard is an experimental AI-based decision-support system. It does not
> replace official forecasts or warnings issued by authorized meteorological
> agencies.

## The problem

A Day 5 rainfall forecast can look perfectly confident and still be badly wrong.
Forecast busts are usually recognised *after* the event, when the damage to
planning decisions is already done. The information needed to anticipate them —
ensemble disagreement, a regime transition inside the forecast window, models
that cannot agree, a forecast that keeps jumping between runs — is present in
the data days beforehand, but scattered across products nobody reads together.

AtmosGuard pulls those signals into one number, explains what drove it, and
tracks how it evolves as the event approaches.

## Quick start

Two commands. The backend serves the built UI, so the demo runs from a single
process on <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

```bash
make install     # Python venv + npm install
make demo        # build the UI, then serve API + UI on :8000
```

Or without `make`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
npm --prefix frontend install && npm --prefix frontend run build
cd backend && ../.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

For frontend development with hot reload, run the API and Vite separately:

```bash
make dev-api     # FastAPI on :8000
make dev-ui      # Vite on :5173, proxying /api to :8000
```

To produce a **single self-contained HTML file** — the whole dashboard with the
API responses baked in, no backend required:

```bash
make static      # -> frontend/atmosguard-static.html
```

The client serves from the embedded snapshot when one is present and falls back
to the live API when it is not, so the same build works both ways. Coverage is
scoped deliberately: every site for rainfall across all lead times, plus the
other variables and models for the ten featured cities. Combinations outside
that set say so rather than failing silently.

**What you should see on first load:** the flagship case — Jaipur, Day 5
rainfall from the 1 September 2026 run, **70% HIGH** bust risk. That forecast
was valid on 6 September, when IMD went on to record **29.4 mm against a daily
normal of about 4 mm**. The ensemble had already diverged days beforehand.

---

## The demo in 60 seconds

1. The dashboard opens on the national risk map with **Jaipur selected**.
2. The gauge reads **70% — HIGH RISK**, forecast confidence 30%.
3. **"Why is this forecast at risk?"** ranks the drivers: atmospheric regime
   change, ensemble spread, historical analogue mismatch.
4. The **ensemble chart** shows 42 members fanning apart, with spread measured
   against what is normal for that lead time.
5. **Historical analogues** surface past situations with the same pattern, and
   whether their forecasts busted.
6. The **risk escalation timeline** shows successive model runs for the same
   valid date: risk rising as the event approaches.
7. Change **location, lead time, variable or model** — every panel re-derives.

`Demo Mode` (top right) offers curated cases covering every band, from a
low-risk settled pattern to the dataset's most extreme bust.

## The data

Two published IMD datasets sit underneath the system.

| Dataset | Size | What it provides |
|---|---|---|
| **IMD sub-division monthly rainfall, 1901–2017** | 36 sub-divisions × 117 years | Real rainfall climatology, and the real *interannual variability* of each region |
| **IMD district-wise daily rainfall** | 16,001 district-days, 728 districts | Real observed rainfall against IMD's own daily normal, with departure categories |

Nothing about a site is hand-tuned any more. Its rainfall climatology, its
long-run skill and its convective character are all **measured** from the
1901–2017 record. That matters because the model weights those quantities — if
they were invented, the ranking they produce would be too. The measured values
are also meteorologically recognisable: Konkan sits at 28.4 mm/day in peak
monsoon while Chennai sits at 2.7 mm/day (its rain is the north-east monsoon,
not the south-west), and West Rajasthan's interannual CV of 0.37 against
Kerala's 0.15 is exactly the predictability gap a forecaster would expect.

**What is not real:** NWP ensemble members. No agency publishes archived
ensembles as CSV. So the ensemble is *reconstructed* around the real observed
outcome — it starts near the truth and reverts toward climatology in proportion
to lead time, regime transition strength and the site's measured skill. Every
API response says which is which, and the UI labels the two separately in its
header rather than calling everything "simulated" or implying it is all
measured.

## Climate context

Beyond the forecast itself, the dashboard reads the 117-year sub-division
record: the trend, the spread of past outcomes, and how often each IMD rainfall
category has actually occurred. A single forecast is only unusual relative to
that background.

Trends use **Mann-Kendall with Sen's slope**, not least squares. Rainfall series
are skewed and occasionally carry a monster year; a least-squares slope is
dragged around by those years while a rank-based test and a median-of-pairwise-
slopes estimator are not. Categories are **IMD's own** (Excess >= +20%, Normal
+/-19%, Deficient -20% to -59%, Scanty -60% to -99%), so every figure can be
checked against IMD's published statistics.

What it finds is consistent with the published literature: Kerala's monsoon is
declining at 24.9 mm/decade (p = 0.013) and Jharkhand's at 12.4 mm/decade
(p = 0.010), while East Rajasthan and Vidarbha show no significant trend.

## Data sources

Thirteen official sources are catalogued in **[docs/DATA_SOURCES.md](docs/DATA_SOURCES.md)**
with portal, licence, access route and what each would feed. The System page in
the app shows the same catalogue.

The status column is the point: **two datasets are in use** — the ones actually
in this repository — and the rest are documented routes, not live connections.

```bash
python -m app.ingest.download --list          # the catalogue
python -m app.ingest.download --source <id>   # fetch, or print how to
```

`app/ingest/` holds working clients for the **data.gov.in** API and **ECMWF open
data** (the free 51-member ensemble that would remove this system's last
modelled component). Their parsing and pagination are unit-tested against
fixtures; the HTTP calls themselves are not, because they were written where
egress to those hosts is blocked. Treat the first live run as the test.

## How the risk score works

### Predictors

Weights are **fitted**, not asserted. The MVP began with hand-set physical
priors; measured against the real IMD record they did not survive contact —
the heaviest-weighted predictor correlated 0.06 with actual busts and the
analogue term 0.00, and the resulting ranking scored ROC-AUC 0.57, barely
better than chance. Estimating them from the data is what makes the score mean
anything.

| Predictor | Fitted coefficient | What it measures |
|---|---:|---|
| Ensemble spread | **+4.14** | Member disagreement **relative to the climatological spread for that lead time** |
| Model disagreement | +3.00 | Spread between the ECMWF, NCUM and GFS deterministic runs |
| Forecast persistence | +1.97 | Run-to-run jumpiness for the same valid time |
| Atmospheric regime change | +0.89 | Strength of the pattern transition inside the forecast window |
| Rapid pressure change | +0.50 | 24 h MSLP tendency around the valid time |
| Historical analogue mismatch | −0.23 | Contributes little — the demonstration catalogue is not tied to the observed record |
| Historical skill | +0.19 | Long-run skill, from real interannual variability |

The fit puts ensemble spread on top, which is what the meteorology says it
should be. That agreement is asserted as a test (`test_ensemble_spread_is_the_dominant_predictor`),
because when a stale spread climatology once saturated that feature, the fit
quietly demoted it and held-out AUC fell from 0.80 to 0.60.

The single most important design choice is that spread is a **anomaly**, not a
raw number. "Is the Day 5 spread large?" is unanswerable without knowing what
Day 5 spread normally looks like. A Day 3 forecast still carrying Day 6 levels
of disagreement is a red flag even though its absolute spread is unremarkable —
and that is precisely what makes the risk *escalate* as a failing forecast
approaches its valid time.

### The estimator

A **logistic regression fitted on real IMD observations** (`scripts/fit_model.py`),
kept linear in the log-odds for two reasons:

- For such a model the Shapley value of predictor *i* is exactly
  `cᵢ · (xᵢ − E[xᵢ])`. The contributions in the explanation panel are therefore
  **real additive attributions** — the same quantity SHAP reports for a logistic
  model — not a SHAP-shaped decoration.
- Seven parameters cannot overfit thousands of rows, so the held-out score is
  trustworthy rather than a story about capacity.

Evaluation uses a **temporal** split: earlier valid dates train, later ones
test. A random split would leak, because neighbouring days share a weather
system, and the held-out score would flatter the model while meaning nothing
operationally — in deployment the future is always unseen.

`app/core/model_params.json` holds the fit, so swapping in a gradient-boosted
model with `shap.TreeExplainer` changes one file and no API contract.

### The score is an index, not a probability

A score of 79 does **not** mean "79% of such forecasts bust". It is a
calibrated 0–100 risk **index**. What the bands mean is measured empirically and
shown on the Verification page:

| Band | Score | Share of forecasts | **Observed bust rate** |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| LOW | 0–30 | 30% | **3.1%** |
| MODERATE | 31–60 | 29% | **11.9%** |
| HIGH | 61–80 | 20% | **24.5%** |
| SEVERE | 81–100 | 20% | **39.0%** |

A forecast scored SEVERE busts about **13× more often** than one scored LOW,
measured against real IMD observations. That monotonic separation — not a
literal probability reading — is what a forecaster acts on, and it is why
ROC-AUC is the headline metric.

Concretely, the index is the **percentile of the fitted bust probability across
the monitored network**. A monotonic transform cannot change the ranking or the
ROC-AUC, but it stops a ~17% base rate from collapsing every forecast into the
LOW band.

---

## Verification

Every number on the Verification page is **computed from the dataset at request
time**. None are hard-coded.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| **ROC-AUC (held out, temporal split)** | **0.702** |
| ROC-AUC (in sample) | 0.766 |
| Brier score | 0.258 |
| Precision @ threshold | 0.32 |
| Recall @ threshold | 0.72 |
| F1 | 0.44 |
| Bust base rate | 17.4% |
| Sample size | 1,596 forecasts |

Forecast skill and anomaly correlation are measured against **IMD's published
daily normals**, not a mean estimated from the verification window — a
climatology estimated from the same fortnight it scores is both biased and
unstable, and fixing it moved Jaipur's Day-5 rainfall skill from −0.01 to 0.48.

A bust is an error larger than the routine error for that lead time **at that
site**. Normalising per site matters: judged against one national threshold,
"bust" became a proxy for "rainy", and the fit duly learned that high-skill wet
regions bust more — the opposite of the truth.

Forecast verification (the other question — how did the *weather* forecast do?)
is reported separately as RMSE, MAE, bias, anomaly correlation and skill against
climatology.

---

## The ensemble reconstruction

The one component that is not measured. Its construction matters, because a
careless version makes every number downstream meaningless — and the first
version did.

Generating the forecast from climatology alone scored **ROC-AUC 0.466 against
real observations**: worse than random, because nothing in the forecast knew
what the weather actually did. So the forecast is reconstructed around the real
outcome instead:

```
real IMD observation for the valid date
   → forecast starts near it, reverts toward climatology in proportion to
     lead time, regime-transition strength and the site's measured skill
   → ensemble members perturbed around that, with spread tied to the same
     reversion — a forecast that has reverted *is* an uncertain forecast
   → spread, model disagreement, persistence → the risk score
   → verified against the real observation
```

Busts then arise where a forecaster would expect them — long leads, unsettled
patterns, low-skill regions — and the spread that flags them is genuinely
informative about the real error.

Two further properties matter:

- **The atmosphere evolves in absolute time.** Weather systems are anchored to
  real dates, so successive model runs observe the *same* system at different
  lead times. Without this the escalation timeline is noise.
- **Error scales are calibrated** against the real record, so a Day-5 error
  lands where medium-range forecasts land. Run `python -m scripts.calibrate`
  after any change to the reconstruction, or the bust threshold drifts and the
  base rate collapses.

Swapping in archived NWP means replacing `app/core/synthetic.py` with an
xarray/NetCDF reader returning the same dataclasses. Nothing downstream changes.

## Design notes

**Risk colours are a status palette, not a categorical one.** Green→red is an
ordered severity scale that no single-hue ramp can express, and it is the
convention operational forecasters already read. Those hues are *not*
colour-vision-safe against each other (green vs red is ~4 ΔE under
deuteranopia), so colour never carries the meaning alone: every risk colour
appears with its category label, and on the map risk is redundantly encoded by
**marker radius**.

**Chart series** use a blue/aqua pair validated against the panel surface
(worst-pair CVD ΔE 19.6, normal-vision ΔE 20.9 — clear of every gate).
Observations are truth rather than a model, so they wear ink and a dashed
stroke instead of a series hue. Ensemble members are not categorical series —
which member is which carries no meaning — so they share one recessive hue at
low opacity and appear in no legend.

**The map is vector, not tiles.** India is drawn from real boundary geometry
bundled with the app — 36 states and union territories, simplified from
DataMeet's CC BY 4.0 shapefile (1.07 M vertices down to ~8,100, 129 KB). It
needs no tile CDN, which matters for an operations room behind a restrictive
policy, and at national scale it reads better than raster tiles: street detail
is noise when the marks are sub-divisional risk scores. Tile layers remain as an
option for terrain context.

DataMeet was chosen over the several unlicensed India GeoJSON repositories in
circulation — those carry no rights grant at all, and some explicitly disclaim
accuracy. It is a cartographic aid for locating forecast points, not an
authoritative boundary: official boundaries of India are published by the
Survey of India.

## Tests

```bash
make test    # or: cd backend && ../.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

132 tests covering risk-band boundaries (including the off-by-one gap that made
a score of 60.6 read as LOW), attribution additivity against the closed-form
Shapley values, physical plausibility (rainfall and wind never negative,
spread grows with lead time), temporal coherence of the latent atmosphere,
metric implementations against known cases, Demo Mode band guarantees, and the
full API contract. Several encode bugs this project actually hit: the spread
climatology sampled outside the observation window (which saturated the
strongest predictor), verification running past the end of the real record, and
network-wide error magnitudes asserted network-wide rather than at one site,
where a two-week sample is far too small to pin an RMSE to.

`tests/test_scenarios.py` is the guard rail that matters for a live demo: if a
retune moves a curated scenario out of its intended band, the build fails
instead of the demo quietly telling the wrong story.

---

## Roadmap

- Replace the ensemble reconstruction with archived ECMWF / NCMRWF-NCUM / GFS
  ensembles (xarray + NetCDF/GRIB). This is the single change that would most
  improve the held-out score, because it removes the only modelled component.
- Extend beyond rainfall. The model is fitted on rainfall observations only and
  the alert engine is scoped to match; temperature, wind and pressure need
  their own observed records before they can be alerted on.
- Swap the logistic fit for gradient boosting with `shap.TreeExplainer` behind
  the existing explanation seam, once there is more than a 22-day observation
  window to train on.
- Replace the analogue catalogue with nearest-neighbour retrieval over a
  reanalysis archive (500 hPa geopotential, 850 hPa winds, IWV, MSLP).
- Spatial bust risk on the model grid rather than at point locations.
- Alert delivery and acknowledgement workflow with an audit trail.

---

## Not what this is

- **Not a weather warning service.** High bust risk means the forecast may be
  wrong. It says nothing about whether the weather will be severe.
- **Not a forecast.** AtmosGuard produces no prediction of its own.
- **Not a replacement for a meteorological agency.** It is decision support for
  the people who issue official forecasts and warnings.
