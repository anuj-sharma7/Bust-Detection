# Data sources

Every dataset AtmosGuard uses or could use, with where it comes from and how to
get it.

## Read this first

Two of these are in the repository and wired in. The rest are **documented
routes, not live connections** - the `status` column says which is which, and
the System page in the running app shows the same thing. Nothing in this project
claims to be fed by a source it is not actually reading.

Portal addresses are stable and are given verbatim. Deep links to individual
files are not: agencies reorganise them, and several portals issue a download
link only after you log in or accept terms. Confirm the exact path at the
source rather than assuming a URL here still resolves.

```bash
python -m app.ingest.download --list            # the catalogue
python -m app.ingest.download --source <id>     # fetch, or print how to
```

| Resolution | Sub-division, monthly |
| Coverage | 1901-2017, 36 sub-divisions, 4,188 rows |
| Format | CSV |
| Licence | Government Open Data Licence - India (GODL). Attribute IMD. |
| Feeds | `app/core/imd.py -> climatology; app/core/climate.py -> trend analytics` |

Rainfall climatology and measured interannual variability for all 36 IMD sub-divisions. Every site constant in AtmosGuard is derived from it.

**How to get it.** Search the OGD catalogue for 'sub divisional monthly rainfall'. Published by IMD under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

### District-wise daily rainfall, actual against normal **[in use]**

**India Meteorological Department (Hydromet Division)** - India

| | |
|---|---|
| Portal | <https://data.gov.in/> |
| Variables | rainfall |
| Resolution | District, daily |
| Coverage | 728 districts, 16,001 district-days in the copy held here |
| Format | CSV |
| Licence | Government Open Data Licence - India (GODL). Attribute IMD. |
| Feeds | `app/core/imd.py -> observations; app/core/verification.py -> bust labels` |

The observations forecasts are verified against, and the source of the bust labels the risk model is fitted on.

**How to get it.** OGD catalogue, 'district wise rainfall'. The same statistics are published daily by IMD's Hydromet Division at https://hydro.imd.gov.in/.

**Note.** Carries real-world untidiness the loader handles: duplicate state spellings (CHHATISGARH / CHHATTISGARH, TAMIL NADU / TAMILNADU) and blank measurements.

### India state and union territory boundaries **[in use]**

**DataMeet India community** - India

| | |
|---|---|
| Portal | <https://github.com/datameet/maps> |
| Variables | geometry |
| Resolution | State / union territory, WGS84 |
| Coverage | Current administrative boundaries |
| Format | Shapefile (converted to GeoJSON at build time) |
| Licence | CC BY 4.0. Attribution required wherever the geometry is shown, which the map's attribution control carries. |
| Feeds | `frontend/src/components/RiskMap.tsx -> the vector base layer` |

The map itself. 36 states and union territories, simplified and bundled with the app so the country renders without any tile CDN.

**How to get it.** States/Admin2 in the repository. `scripts/build_basemap.py` downloads it, simplifies 1.07 M vertices to about 8,100, and writes frontend/src/lib/india-basemap.json.

**Note.** Chosen over the several unlicensed India GeoJSON repositories in circulation: those carry no rights grant at all, and some explicitly disclaim accuracy. A cartographic aid, not an authoritative boundary - official boundaries of India are published by the Survey of India.

### ECMWF open forecast data (HRES and ENS)

**European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts** - International

| | |
|---|---|
| Portal | <https://data.ecmwf.int/forecasts/> |
| Variables | rainfall, temperature, wind, pressure |
| Resolution | 0.25 degree, 51 ensemble members, 3-hourly to T+144 |
| Coverage | Real time, roughly the last four days retained |
| Format | GRIB2 |
| Licence | Creative Commons CC BY 4.0. Attribute ECMWF. |
| Feeds | `Would replace app/core/synthetic.py entirely` |

Real ensemble members. This is the single dataset that would remove the last modelled component from AtmosGuard - the reconstruction exists only because no ensemble archive was to hand.

**How to get it.** No registration. Use the official client: `pip install ecmwf-opendata`, then request stream='enfo' (ensemble) or 'oper' (deterministic). See app/ingest/ecmwf_open.py.

**Note.** Only a few days of history are kept, so building a training archive means collecting it daily. That is the real cost of moving off the reconstruction, and it is why this is a roadmap item rather than a quick fix.

### GFS and GEFS operational output

**NOAA / NCEP** - United States

| | |
|---|---|
| Portal | <https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/> |
| Variables | rainfall, temperature, wind, pressure |
| Resolution | GFS 0.25 degree; GEFS 0.5 degree, 31 members |
| Coverage | Real time; archives at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/ |
| Format | GRIB2 |
| Licence | US Government work - public domain. |
| Feeds | `app/core/domain.py -> the GFS model entry` |

The third model in the comparison, and a genuinely independent one - which is what makes model disagreement informative rather than circular.

**How to get it.** NOMADS serves current cycles directly over HTTP, including GRIB subsetting. Older cycles come from the NCEI archive.

### India Water Resources Information System

**Ministry of Jal Shakti / Central Water Commission** - India

| | |

| | |
|---|---|
| Portal | <https://www.ncmrwf.gov.in/> |
| Variables | rainfall, temperature, wind, pressure |
| Resolution | NCUM-G 12 km global; NEPS 12 km, 22 members |
| Coverage | Operational, real time |
| Format | GRIB2 / NetCDF |
| Licence | By agreement with NCMRWF. |
| Feeds | `app/core/domain.py -> the NCMRWF-NCUM model entry` |

India's own operational medium-range model and its ensemble - the regional counterpart the dashboard compares against ECMWF and GFS.

**How to get it.** Products are shown publicly on the site; bulk data access needs a request to NCMRWF, normally with institutional affiliation.

## Attribution

The two IMD datasets in this repository are published by the **India
Meteorological Department**, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India,
under the Government Open Data Licence - India (GODL). Any work built on them
should say so.

## What is still missing

The one component of AtmosGuard that is not measured is the **ensemble**. No
agency publishes an archive of historical ensemble members as a convenient
download, so the system reconstructs them around the real observed outcome and
labels that plainly throughout.

Two sources would close that gap, in order of effort:

1. **ECMWF open data** - real 51-member ensembles, free, no registration, but
   only a few days are retained. Collect daily to build an archive.
2. **TIGGE** - the proper answer: ten centres' ensembles back to 2006, which is
   what a bust-risk model should really be trained on. Needs a free ECMWF
   account and patience with the retrieval queue.
